### About the project

Motivation: There is an increasing demand for data to make informed decisions when it comes to managing money. Investment is a choice, but market participation is not. Every party is a market participant, including large organisations. This project aims to use a toy api (with toy data) to prototype how data can be delivered to stakeholders in a user friendly fashion.

Description: A dashboard project to allow users to explore economic data from [an api](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Real-time_Prices). Project is decomposed into two parts:

- A data pipeline running on aws ec2 cron job that

  - extracts from the api
  - transforms data for cleaning
  - loads data into an AWS RDS database

- A streamlit dashboard for retrieving the data, and displaying

  - price and volume of featured items
  - weighted midprice of market indices
  - price, volume, and delta-KDE of user queried items
  - a list of correlated items
  - top 100 charts of: price rises, price falls, most traded, most expensive
  - lookup tables for interchanging item names and IDs
  - custom SQL query results
